# Rooted-Tree-Functions
The program uses a dictionary to represent a tree where the key is the parent vertex and the data values are the children. Functions include finding the parent of the vertex, a path to the parent, a path between two vertices, finding the a subtree given a vertex, and finding two trees when an edge is removed. This was for my Discrete Mathematics II class. This is written in Python.
